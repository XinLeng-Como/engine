# GLTF Entity Exporter Script for PlayCanvas Editor

This script allows you to export any entity and its children to a GLB file at runtime in PlayCanvas Editor 1.77+.

## Installation

1. Copy the `gltf-entity-exporter.js` file to your PlayCanvas project's Scripts folder
2. The script will automatically appear in the Scripts panel

## Usage

### Adding the Script to an Entity

1. Select the entity you want to make exportable in the Hierarchy
2. In the Inspector panel, click "Add Component" â†’ "Script"
3. Click "Add Script" and select `gltfEntityExporter` from the dropdown
4. Configure the script attributes as needed

### Script Attributes

The script provides several configurable attributes:

- **Button Text** (string): Text displayed on the export button
  - Default: "Export to GLB"

- **Button Position** (vec2): Position of the button from the top-left corner
  - Default: [10, 10] (10px from top, 10px from left)

- **Button Size** (vec2): Width and height of the button in pixels
  - Default: [150, 40]

- **Max Texture Size** (number): Maximum texture resolution in the exported GLB
  - Default: 1024 (set to 0 for no limit)
  - Higher values = better quality but larger file size

- **File Name** (string): Name of the downloaded GLB file
  - Default: "exported-entity.glb"

- **Export Children** (boolean): Whether to include child entities in the export
  - Default: true
  - When false, only the entity with the script will be exported

### How It Works

1. When you launch your project, a blue export button will appear at the configured position
2. Clicking the button will:
   - Export the entity (and children if enabled) to GLB format
   - Automatically download the file to your browser's download folder
   - Show progress feedback on the button

### Button States

The button provides visual feedback:
- **Blue**: Ready to export
- **Gray**: Export in progress
- **Green**: Export completed successfully
- **Red**: Export failed

### Example Use Cases

1. **Export a single 3D model**: Attach to a model entity with `Export Children` disabled
2. **Export a complete scene section**: Attach to a parent entity with `Export Children` enabled
3. **Export with optimized textures**: Set `Max Texture Size` to 512 or 1024 for smaller files

### Technical Notes

- The script uses PlayCanvas's built-in `GltfExporter` class
- Exported GLB files are compatible with standard 3D software and web viewers
- The script automatically handles cleanup of temporary resources
- Multiple export buttons can be used simultaneously on different entities

### Troubleshooting

- **Export fails**: Check the browser console for error details
- **Button not visible**: Verify the button position is within the viewport
- **Large file sizes**: Reduce the `Max Texture Size` setting
- **Missing geometry**: Ensure the entity has render components or child entities with render components

### Compatibility

- PlayCanvas Editor 1.77+
- Modern browsers with support for Blob and download APIs
- Works in both development and published projects
